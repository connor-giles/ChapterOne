# 📖 ChapterOne

**ChapterOne** is project Im working on in my spare time to help broaded my skills, to learn full-stack development, and get more comfortable with JavaScript. Oh, and to fix an anooying problem I have... 

**I dont like the way GoodReads looks!** It looks outdated and, I'm looking for a nice clean user experience.

Will we get that with my first foray into web-dev? Probably not, but let's see what we can accomplish!

## 📝 What It Is

So what exactly will **ChapterOne** do? 

Well, that will continue to change as time goes on. But I want the core functionality to not re-invent the wheel. 

Track books you've read, want to read, or currently reading. Give them a rating when you're done. 

Simple as that! 

Right now its mostly held together by console logs and duct tape, but it will get better each day

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (subject to change)

- **JavaScript** – core front-end language across the app
- **Python** - core back-end language for routing
- **HTML/CSS** – basic UI and layout
- **[Frontend Framework]** – Nothing set up at the moment, maybe React in the future?
- **Flask** – Backend framework
- **[Database]** – TBD

It’ll probably evolve as I go.

## 🎯 Goals

The main focus of this is to learn something new, not make the next big app. Some of my rough goals are below

- Learn and write cleaner JavaScript
- Understanding how frontend and backend connect
- Getting comfortable with APIs and async code
- Learning how to structure a project
- Building something end-to-end from scratch
